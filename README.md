# HTTP Web Server

Built entirely on Rust. This project is neither ready to be used for production nor development.
Only for the purpose of learning Rust and building a web server from scratch I have started
building this project.

You can contribute, If you wish to learn along with me.

In case this project fails to compile that's because I am using scylladb as Database. You will need to download Scylladb or Cassandra database to your local machine.
